 # Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle

This project allows users to switch between **dark mode** and **light mode** using buttons. It dynamically changes the background color of the webpage based on the user's selection.

## Features

- **Dark Mode**: Changes the background color of the webpage to a pleasant aquamarine color.
- **Light Mode**: Resets the background color to white for a clean and bright interface.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The HTML contains two buttons:
   - A button with the ID `button` for enabling **dark mode**.
   - A button with the ID `button1` for enabling **light mode**.

2. **JavaScript**: 
   - The JavaScript listens for click events on both buttons.
   - When the dark mode button (`button`) is clicked, the background color changes to **aquamarine**.
   - When the light mode button (`button1`) is clicked, the background color resets to **white**.
